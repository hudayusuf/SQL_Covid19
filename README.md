# SQL_Covid19

In this SQL project, I performed an exploratory analysis on COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data spanning from March 2020 to June 2021. The analysis involved using a range of basic to advanced SQL queries.

The raw dataset was downloaded from Our World in Data.

I utilized MS-SQL Server to import the Excel files into a SQL database on my local machine for further analysis.
